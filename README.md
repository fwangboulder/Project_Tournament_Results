Project 4 Udacity Full Stack Developer Nanodegree

developed a database schema to store the game matches between players and wrote
code to query this data and determine the winners of various games.

Quick Start:
    -   Add players into database with register_player() function.
        Function takes string text as a parameter.
    -   Archive match results by reporting them with report_match().
        report_match() takes in winner id and loser id
        (respectively). Optionally, it takes in the tournament id.
    -   swiss_pairings() function will calculate the next pair of
        matchups that satisfies the Swiss-system property.
